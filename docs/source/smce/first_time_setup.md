# First time setup

If you believe you need access to the SMCE, contact Greg Olmschenk on the RGES-PIT Slack, and we'll discuss getting you set up.

## SSH access

After you have been approved for SMCE access, you will need to send an SSH public key to the Roman Project Computing Infrastructure Team. First generate a new SSH key public/private pair. On macOS and Linux, from the terminal, run
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/nasa_smce
```
and follow the prompts. This will create two files, the private key `~/.ssh/nasa_smce` and the public key `~/.ssh/nasa_smce.pub`. Never share the private key with anyone. Send the public key along with a preferred username to Greg Olmschenk.

Once you have received confirmation from that your SMCE account has been created, add the following to your SSH configuration file (located at `~/.ssh/config` on macOS and Linux). Replace `{your_user_name}` with the username you received.
```
Host smce-east1
    HostName 3.220.181.22
    User {your_user_name}
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/nasa_smce
```

Now, you should be able to SSH into the SMCE with
```
ssh smce-east1
```

## Setting up your environment

```{warning}
The SMCE Spack Conda configuration currently has a bug (as of 2025-09-01), and this configuration script sets up that Conda environment to activate on connecting to the SMCE. Until this bug in the SMCE Spack Conda configuration is corrected, use this setup at your own risk. 
```

The first time you log into the server, run the below command to set up your environment. This command will do several things, including ensuring that you have a working Conda environment containing a version of Python that is active whenever you log in.
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golmschenk/rges_pit_pipeline_tools/refs/heads/main/scripts/rges_pit_scme_setup_script.sh | bash
```
After running this script, either restart the terminal session or run `source ~/.bashrc`.
