# SMCE documentation

The Science Managed Cloud Environment (SMCE) is the primary platform for RGES-PIT computing needs. This documentation provides an explanation of the platform, setup tools, and tutorials/examples of programs that use the distributed cluster.

```{note}
The SMCE is connected to, but distinct from, the Roman Research Nexus. See [the platform overview documentation](./platform_overview.md) for more details.
